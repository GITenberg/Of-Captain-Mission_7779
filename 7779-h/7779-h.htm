    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Defoe has been recognized as the author of <i>A General History of the
      Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates</i> since 1932 when
      John Robert Moore suggested that the supposed author, Captain Charles
      Johnson, like Andrew Moreton, Kara Selym or Captain Roberts, was merely
      another mask for the creator of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. Although most of
      the first volume is of minor literary importance, the second section which
      appeared in 1728 as <i>The History of the Pyrates</i> commenced with a
      life "Of Captain Misson and His Crew," one of Defoe's most remarkable and
      neglected works of fiction. In much the same manner and at the same time
      that John Gay was satirizing Walpole's government in <i>The Beggar's Opera</i>,
      Defoe began to use his pirates as a commentary on the injustice and
      hypocrisy of contemporary English society. Among Defoe's gallery of
      pirates are Captain White, who refused to rob from women and children;
      Captain Bellamy, the proletarian revolutionist; and captain North, whose
      sense of justice and honesty was a rebuke to the corruption of government
      under Walpole. But the fictional Captain Misson, the founder of a
      communist utopia, is by far the most original of these creations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we were to accept the view of nineteenth-century critics, that Defoe
      was one of the earliest exponents of <i>laissez faire</i>, his creation of
      a communist utopia would seem remarkable indeed. But paradoxes fascinated
      Defoe, and his ideas can seldom be reduced to unambiguous platitudes. He
      was especially fascinated by the comparison between businessmen and
      thieves. In 1707 he urged the government to pardon the Madagascar pirates
      if they agreed to stop their crimes, pay a large sum of money and "become
      honest Freeholders, as others of our <i>West-India</i> Pyrates, <i>Merchants
      I should have said</i>, have done before them." And he noted that "it
      would make a sad Chasm on the <i>Exchange of London</i>, if all the
      Pyrates should be taken away from the Merchants there."<a
      href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1" id="linknoteref-1"><small>1</small></a>
      Twelve years later just before the start of the South Sea Bubble, Defoe
      attacked stock-jobbing as "a Branch of Highway Robbing."<a
      href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2"><small>2</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although these attacks were directed mainly at "trade thieves" and
      corruptions in business practices, they reflect Defoe's growing concern
      with problems of poverty and wealth in England. In his preface to the
      first volume of the <i>General History of the Pyrates</i>, Defoe argued
      that the unemployed seaman had no choice but to "<i>steal or starve</i>."
      When the pirate, Captain Bellamy, boards a merchant ship from Boston, he
      attacks the inequality of capitalist society, the ship owners, and most of
      all, the Captain:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>damn ye, you are a sneaking Puppy, and so are all those who will submit
      to be governed by Laws which rich Men have made for their own Security,
      for the cowardly Whelps have not the Courage otherwise to defend what they
      get by their Knavery; but damn ye altogether: Damn them for a Pack of
      crafty Rascals, and you, who serve them, for a Parcel of hen-hearted
      Numskuls. They villify us, the Scoundrels do, when there is only this
      Difference, they rob the Poor under the Cover of Law, forsooth, and we
      plunder the Rich under the Protection of our own Courage.</i><a
      href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellamy asks the crew of the captured ship to abandon the slavery of
      working for low wages under severe captains for the complete economic and
      political equality of life on a pirate ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Government on Captain Misson's ship, the <i>Victoire</i>, and in the
      colony of Libertalia is partially an idealization of the pirate's creed.
      But two other elements which must be considered are, first, the concept of
      government in the state of nature, and secondly, the ideal of the
      socialist utopia. Most political theorists of Defoe's time postulated a
      state of nature in which man lived either entirely free from government or
      under loose patriarchal control, from which he was removed either by the
      invention of money, the discovery of agriculture or by some crime. To a
      certain extent, Misson's pirate government may be regarded as a stage in
      the evolution of government. In <i>The Farther Adventures of Robinson
      Crusoe</i>, Defoe showed how government evolved from the anarchy of the
      state of nature. Both Crusoe's colony and Libertalia are eventually forced
      to establish government, private property and criminal laws, but
      Libertalia, which retains its egalitarian and democratic character, is
      overthrown by its failure to account for human evil and crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second influence on Captain Misson's ideology is Plutarch's description
      of the laws of Sparta and Rome. Even during the "Anti-Communist Period"
      which followed the Glorious Revolution, the well-regulated state of the
      Lacedemonians remained the norm for Utopias. The influence of Plutarch
      pervades the biographies in the <i>General History of the Pyrates.</i>
      Lycurgus' laws echo throughout Misson's attacks on luxury and the unequal
      distribution of wealth, while Plutarch's study of Spartacus, which is
      mentioned in Defoe's preface, may well have been the model for his hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither the desire to regain the purity of the state of nature nor an
      admiration for Spartan simplicity entirely explain Misson's vigorous
      demand for freedom and his attacks on the corruption of the ruling class.
      By refusing to fly the pirate flag, Misson dramatizes the growing revolt
      of the poor against a useless nobility. The crew of the <i>Victoire</i>
      are, prophetically enough, French. Their aspiration is for a society
      following the precepts of <i>la carrière ouverte aux talents</i>; their
      revolt is that of a few courageous men unafraid to engage in the pirate's
      "war against mankind" while those of lesser courage "dance to the Musick
      of their Chains."
    </p>
    <p>
      Defoe's study of Misson is different from the Utopias of More, Bacon or
      Campanella in so far as there is no discovery of an ideal civilization.
      Libertalia is a Utopia which reflects a direct reaction to the abuses of
      the time&mdash;abuses of economic, political and religious freedom.
      Anticipating Beccaria's criticism of the death penalty by almost forty
      years, Carracioli argues that since man's right to life is inalienable, no
      government can have the power of capital punishment.<a href="#linknote-4"
      name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a> Misson's
      belief in equality is extended to include the negro slaves the <i>Victoire</i>
      takes at sea as well as the natives of Madagascar. After asking the
      negroes to join his crew, Misson tells his men that the Trading for those
      of our own Species, could never be agreeable to the Eyes of divine
      Justice: That no Man had Power of the Liberty of another; and while those
      who profess'd a more enlightened Knowledge of the Deity, sold men like
      Beasts; they prov'd that their Religion was no more than Crimace...: For
      his Part he hop'd, he spoke the Sentiments of all his brave Companions, he
      had not exempted his Neck from the galling Yoak of Slavery, and asserted
      his own Liberty to enslave others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slavery is banished from Misson's ship, and the negroes are schooled in
      the principles of freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most difficult problem in discussing the principles of Misson
      and Carracioli is to attempt an explanation of why Defoe, a Presbyterian,
      should have made his protagonists into deists. Defoe attacks Carracioli's
      deistic arguments through his narrator, Captain Johnson, who remarks that
      such ideas are pernicious only to "weak Men who cannot discover their
      Fallacy." But since similar ideas appear in Robert <i>Drury's Journal</i>
      published a year later, it may be assumed that the arguments of the deists
      held a certain fascination for Defoe at this time. Carracioli's deism also
      has a dramatic function in the story. That on a voyage to Rome a young man
      like Misson should be converted to deism by a disillusioned "lewd" priest
      was in harmony with the traditional English belief in the dangers of
      Italy.<a href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5"><small>5</small></a>
      That Carracioli should combine the rebellion against organized religion
      with the revolt against monarchy is indicative of Defoe's keen
      apprehension of the future course of history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considered as a short novel, the history "Of Captain Misson and his Crew"
      reveals many of the same techniques which Defoe used in his longer works.
      To gain a sense of verisimilitude the narrator pretends to be working from
      a manuscript, a device which Defoe also employed in his <i>Memoirs of a
      Cavalier</i>. As in <i>Colonel Jack</i> real historical figures and events
      from the War of the Spanish Succession are woven into the adventures of
      the <i>Victoire</i>. Captain Misson and his crew sink the Winchelsea, an
      English ship lost in the West Indies at the end of August, 1707, and they
      barely escape from Admiral Wager's fleet which fought a famous battle
      there in 1708. Even the name of Misson's ship, the <i>Victoire</i>; was
      undoubtedly familiar to Defoe as the vessel commanded by the famous French
      corsair, Cornil Saus.<a href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6"
      id="linknoteref-6"><small>6</small></a> So convincing is Defoe that
      although his hero is shown meeting a real freebooter, Captain Tew, ten
      years after Tew's death, Misson is still included in the histories of
      piracy.<a href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><small>7</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also typical of Defoe's fiction is the relationship between Captain
      Misson, the leader, and his intellectual mentor, Carracioli. Colonel Jack
      and his tutor, Moll Flanders and her Governess and particularly, Captain
      Singleton and William Walters form similar groups. Just as William
      Walters, a Quaker, reminds Captain Singleton and the crew that their
      business is not fighting but making money, so Carracioli addresses lengthy
      speeches to the crew, converting everyone on the <i>Victoire</i> to
      democracy and deism. Misson's Libertalia takes root in Madagascar, where
      Singleton wanted to establish a colony, while both Carracioli and Walters
      adapt the secular aspects of their religion to piracy. But whereas Walters
      eventually converts Singleton into an honest Christian, Carracioli leads
      Misson into piracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the history "Of Captain Misson and his Crew," Defoe decided to pursue
      the same method of third person narrative as in his brief biographies of
      real pirates. The result is that he merely provides a sketch of political
      theories rather than a study of human beings. Of course there are good
      reasons for this. Defoe was more interested in dramatizing proletarian
      utopian ideals than in developing the inner workings of Misson's mind. The
      novelette is unified by its epic theme, not by its study of character or
      its episodic plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Defoe toyed with radical notions throughout <i>The History of the
      Pyrates</i>, he had little faith in their practicality. Libertalia must be
      understood as Defoe's best expression of political and social ideals which
      he admired but considered unworkable. The continuation of Misson's career
      in the section "Of Captain Tew" depicts the decline and fall of the utopia
      and the hero's tragic death as a disillusioned idealist. This, however, is
      another story, a story which suggested that private property was
      necessary, equality impossible and slavery a useful expedient for
      colonization. It was a far more comforting message for the Augustan Age,
      but it could not silence the tocsins of the French Revolution which sound
      throughout the speeches of Misson and Carracioli.

    <h2>
      OF CAPTAIN MISSON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We can be somewhat particular in the Life of this Gentleman, because, by
      very great Accident, we have got into our Hands a <i>French</i>
      Manuscript, in which he himself gives a Detail of his Actions. He was born
      in <i>Provence</i>, of an ancient Family; his Father, whose true Name he
      conceals, was Master of a plentiful Fortune; but having a great Number of
      Children, our Rover had but little Hopes of other Fortune than what he
      could carve out for himself with his Sword. His Parents took Care to give
      him an Education equal to his Birth. After he had passed his Humanity and
      Logick, and was a tolerable Mathematician, at the Age of Fifteen he was
      sent to <i>Angiers</i>, where he was a Year learning His Exercises. His
      Father, at his Return home, would have put him into the Musketeers; but as
      he was of a roving Temper, and much affected with the Accounts he had read
      in Books of Travels, he chose the Sea as a Life which abounds with more
      Variety, and would afford him an Opportunity to gratify his Curiosity, by
      the Change of Countries Having made this Choice, his Father, with Letters
      of Recommendation, and every Thing fitting for him, sent him Voluntier on
      board the <i>Victoire</i>, commanded by Monsieur <i>Fourbin</i>, his
      Relation. He was received on Board with all possible Regard by the
      Captain, whose Ship was at <i>Marseilles</i>, and was order'd to cruise
      soon after <i>Misson's</i> Arrival. Nothing could be more agreeable to the
      Inclinations of our Voluntier than this Cruize, which made him acquainted
      with the most noted Ports of the <i>Mediterranean</i>, and gave him a
      great Insight into the practical Part of Navigation. He grew fond of this
      Life, and was resolved to be a compleat Sailor, which made him always one
      of the first on a Yard Arm, either to Hand or Reef, and very inquisitive
      in the different Methods of working a Ship: His Discourse was turn'd on no
      other Subject, and he would often get the Boatswain and Carpenter to teach
      him in their Cabbins the constituent Parts of a Ship's Hull, and how to
      rigg her, which he generously paid 'em for; and tho' he spent a great Part
      of his Time with these two Officers, yet he behaved himself with such
      Prudence that they never attempted at a Familiarity, and always paid the
      Respect due to his Family. The Ship being at <i>Naples</i>, he obtained
      Leave of his Captain to go to <i>Rome</i>, which he had a great Desire to
      visit. Hence we may date his Misfortunes; for, remarking the licentious
      Lives of the Clergy (so different from the Regularity observ'd among the
      <i>French</i> Ecclesiasticks,) the Luxury of the Papal Court, and that
      nothing but Hulls of Religion was to be found in the Metropolis of the
      Christian Church, he began to figure to himself that all Religion was no
      more than a Curb upon the Minds of the Weaker, which the wiser Sort
      yielded to, in Appearance only. These Sentiments, so disadvantageous to
      Religion and himself, were strongly riveted by accidentally becoming
      acquainted with a lewd Priest, who was, at his Arrival (by meer Chance)
      his Confessor, and after that his Procurer and Companion, for he kept him
      Company to his Death. One Day, having an Opportunity, he told <i>Misson</i>,
      a Religious was a very good Life, where a Man had a subtle enterprising
      Genius, and some Friends; for such a one wou'd, in a short Time, rise to
      such Dignities in the Church, the Hopes of which was the Motive of all the
      wiser Sort, who voluntarily took upon them the sacerdotal Habit. That the
      ecclesiastical State was govern'd with the same Policy as were secular
      Principalities and Kingdoms; that what was beneficial, not what was
      meritorious and virtuous, would be alone regarded. That there were no more
      Hopes for a Man of Piety and Learning in the Patrimony of St. <i>Peter</i>,
      than in any other Monarchy, nay, rather less; for this being known to be
      real, that Man's rejected as a Visionary, no way fit for Employment; as
      one whose Scruples might prove prejudicial; for its a Maxim, that Religion
      and Politicks can never set up in one House. As to our Statesmen, don't
      imagine that the Purple makes 'em less Courtiers than are those of other
      Nations; they know and pursue the <i>Reggione del Stato</i> (a Term of Art
      which means Self-Interest) with as much Cunning and as little Conscience
      as any Secular; and are as artful where Art is required, and as barefaced
      and impudent when their Power is great enough to support 'em, in the
      oppressing the People, and aggrandizing their Families. What their Morals
      are, you may read in the Practice of their Lives, and their Sentiments of
      Religion from this Saying of a certain Cardinal, <i>Quantum Lucrum ex ista
      fabula Christi!</i> which many of 'em may say, tho' they are not so
      foolish. For my Part, I am quite tir'd of the Farce, and will lay hold on
      the first Opportunity to throw off this masquerading Habit; for, by Reason
      of my Age, I must act an under Part many Years; and before I can rise to
      share the Spoils of the People, I shall, I fear, be too old to enjoy the
      Sweets of Luxury; and, as I am an Enemy to Restraint, I am apprehensive I
      shall never act up to my Character, and carry thro' the Hypocrite with Art
      enough to rise to any considerable Post in the Church. My Parents did not
      consult my Genius, or they would have given me a Sword instead of a Pair
      of Beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Misson</i> advised him to go with him Voluntier, and offer'd him Money
      to cloath him; the Priest leap'd at the Proposal, and a Letter coming to
      <i>Misson</i> from his Captain, that he was going to <i>Leghorn</i>, and
      left to him either to come to <i>Naples</i>, or go by Land; he chose the
      latter, and the <i>Dominican</i>, whom he furnish'd with Money, clothing
      himself very Cavalierly, threw off his Habit, and preceeded him two Days,
      staying at <i>Pisa</i> for <i>Misson</i>; from whence they went together
      to <i>Leghorn</i>, where they found the <i>Victoire</i>, and Signor <i>Caraccioli</i>,
      recommended by his Friend, was received on Board. Two Days after they
      weigh'd from hence, and after a Week's Cruize fell in with two <i>Sally</i>
      Men, the one of twenty, the other of twenty four Guns; the <i>Victoire</i>
      had but thirty mounted, though she had Ports for forty. The Engagement was
      long and bloody, for the <i>Sally</i> Man hop'd to carry the <i>Victoire</i>;
      and, on the contrary, Captain <i>Fourbin</i>, so far from having any
      Thoughts of being taken, he was resolutely bent to make Prize of his
      Enemies, or sink his Ship. One of the <i>Sally</i> Men was commanded by a
      <i>Spanish</i> Renegade, (though he had only the Title of a Lieutenant)
      for the Captain was a young Man who knew little of Marine Affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Ship was called the <i>Lyon</i>; and he attempted, more than once, to
      board the <i>Victoire</i>, but by a Shot betwixt Wind and Water, he was
      obliged to sheer off, and running his Guns, &amp;c. on one Side, bring her
      on the careen to stop his Leak; this being done with too much
      Precipitation, she overset, and every Soul was lost: His Comrade seeing
      this Disaster, threw out all his small sails, and endeavour'd to get off,
      but the <i>Victoire</i> wrong'd her, and oblig'd her to renew the Fight,
      which she did with great Obstinacy, and made Monsieur <i>Fourbin</i>
      despair of carrying her if he did not board; he made Preparations
      accordingly. Signior <i>Caraccioli</i> and <i>Misson</i> were the two
      first on board when the Command was given; but they and their Followers
      were beat back by the Despair of the <i>Sally</i> Men; the former received
      a Shot in his Thigh, and was carried down to the Surgeon. The <i>Victoire</i>
      laid her on board the second time, and the <i>Sally</i> Men defended their
      Decks with such Resolution, that they were cover'd with their own, and the
      dead Bodies of their Enemies. <i>Misson</i> seeing one of 'em jump down
      the Main-Hatch with a lighted Match, suspecting his Design, resolutely
      leap'd after him, and reaching him with his Sabre, laid him dead the
      Moment he going to set Fire to the Powder. The <i>Victoire</i> pouring in
      more Men, the <i>Mahometans</i> quitted the Decks, finding Resistance
      vain, and fled for Shelter to the Cook Room, Steerage and Cabbins, and
      some run between Decks. The <i>French</i> gave 'em Quarters, and put the
      Prisoners on board the <i>Victoire</i>, the Prize yielding nothing worth
      mention, except Liberty to about fifteen Christian Slaves; she was carried
      into and sold with the Prisoners at <i>[text unreadable]</i>. The Turks
      lost a great many Men, the <i>French</i> not less than 35 in boarding, for
      they lost very few by the great Shot, the <i>Sally</i> Men firing mostly
      at the Masts and Rigging, hoping by disabling to carry her. The limited
      Time of their Cruize being out, the <i>Victoire</i> returned to <i>Marseilles</i>,
      from whence <i>Misson</i>, taking his Companion, went to visit his
      Parents, to whom the Captain sent a very advantageous Character, both of
      his Courage and Conduct. He was about a Month at home when his Captain
      wrote to him, that his Ship was ordered to <i>Rochelle</i>, from whence he
      was to sail for the <i>West-Indies</i> with some Merchant Men. This was
      very agreeable to <i>Misson</i> and Signior <i>Caraccioli</i>, who
      immediately set out for <i>Marseilles</i>. This Town is well fortified,
      has four Parish Churches, and the Number of Inhabitants is computed to be
      about 120,0000; the Harbour is esteemed the safest in the <i>Mediterranean</i>,
      and is the common Station for the <i>French</i> Gallies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving this Place, they steer'd for <i>Rochelle</i>, where the <i>Victoire</i>
      was dock'd, the Merchant Ships not being near ready. <i>Misson</i>, who
      did not Care to pass so long a Time in Idleness, proposed to his Comrade
      the taking a Cruize on board the <i>Triumph</i>, who was going into the <i>English
      Channel</i>; the <i>Italian</i> readily contented to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the Isle of <i>Guernsey</i> and the <i>Start Point</i> they met
      with the <i>Mayflower</i>, Captain <i>Balladine</i> Commanded, a Merchant
      Ship of 18 Guns, richly laden, and coming from <i>Jamaica</i>. The Captain
      of the <i>English</i> made a gallant resistance, and fought his Ship so
      long, that the <i>French</i> could not carry her into Harbour, wherefore
      they took the Money, and what was most valuable, out of her; and finding
      she made more Water than the Pumps could free, quitted, and saw her go
      down in less than four Hours after. Monsieur <i>le Blanc</i>, the <i>French</i>
      Captain, received Captain <i>Balladine</i> very civilly, and would not
      suffer either him or his Men to be stripp'd, saying, <i>None but Cowards
      ought be treated after that Manner; that brave Men ought to treat such,
      though their Enemies, as Brothers; and that to use a gallant Man (who does
      his Duty) ill, speaks a Revenge which cannot proceed but from a Coward
      Soul.</i> He order'd that the Prisoners should leave their Chests; and
      when some of his Men seem'd to mutter, he bid 'em remember the Grandeur of
      the Monarch they serv'd; that they were neither Pyrates nor Privateers;
      and, as brave Men, they ought to shew their Enemies an Example they would
      willingly have follow'd, and use their Prisoners as they wish'd to be
      us'd.
    </p>
    <p>
      They running up the <i>English</i> Channel as high as <i>Beachy Head</i>,
      and, in returning, fell in with three fifty Gun Ships, which gave Chace to
      the <i>Triumph</i>; but as she was an excellent Sailor, she run 'em out of
      Sight in seven Glasses, and made the best of her Way for the <i>Lands-End</i>
      they here cruized eight Days, then doubling Cape <i>Cornwall</i>, ran up
      the <i>Bristol</i> Channel, near as far as <i>Nash Point</i>, and
      intercepted a small Ship from <i>Barbadoes</i>, and stretching away to the
      Northward, gave Chase to a Ship they saw in the Evening, but lost her in
      the Night. The <i>Triumph</i> stood then towards <i>Milford</i> and spying
      a Sail, endeavour'd to cut her off the Land, but found it impossible; for
      she got into the Haven, though they came up with her very fast, and she
      had surely been taken, had the Chase had been any thing longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain <i>Balladine</i>, who took the Glass, said it was the <i>Port
      Royal</i>, a <i>Bristol</i> Ship which left <i>Jamaica</i> in Company with
      him and the <i>Charles</i>. They now return'd to their own Coast, and sold
      their Prize at <i>Brest</i>, where, at his Desire, they left Captain <i>Balladine</i>,
      and Monsieur <i>le Blanc</i> made him a Present of Purse with 40 <i>Louis's</i>
      for his Support; his Crew were also left here.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Entrance into this Harbour the <i>Triumph</i> struck upon a Rock,
      but receiv'd no Damage: This Entrance, called <i>Genlet</i>, is very
      dangerous on Account of the Number of Rocks which lie on each Side under
      Water, though the Harbour is certainly the best in <i>France</i>. The
      Mouth of the Harbour is defended by a strong Castle; the Town is well
      fortified, and has a Citadel for its farther Defence, which is of
      considerable Strength. In 1694 the <i>English</i> attempted a Descent, but
      did not find their Market, for they were beat off with the Loss of their
      General, and a great many Men. From hence the <i>Triumph</i> return'd to
      <i>Rochel</i>, and in a Month after our Voluntiers, who went on board the
      <i>Victoire</i>, took their Departure for <i>Martineco</i> and <i>Guadalupe</i>;
      they met with nothing in their Voyage thither worth noting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall only observe, that Signior <i>Caraccioli</i>, who was as ambitious
      as he was irreligious, had, by this Time, made a perfect Deist of <i>Misson</i>,
      and thereby convinc'd him, that all Religion was no other than human
      Policy, and shew'd him that the Law of <i>Moses</i> was no more than what
      were necessary, as well for the Preservation as the Governing of the
      People; for Instance, said he, the <i>African</i> Negroes never heard of
      the Institution of Circumcision, which is said to be the Sign of the
      Covenant made between God and this People, and yet they circumcise their
      Children; doubtless for the same Reason the <i>Jews</i> and other Nations
      do, who inhabit the Southern Climes, the Prepuce consolidating the
      perspired Matter, which is of a fatal Consequence. In short, he ran
      through all the Ceremonies of the <i>Jewish</i>, Christian and <i>Mahometan</i>
      Religion, and convinced him these were, as might be observed by the
      Absurdity of many, far from being Indications of Men inspired; and that <i>Moses</i>,
      in his Account of the Creation, was guilty of known Blunders; and the
      Miracles, both in the New and Old Testament, inconsistent with Reason.
      That God had given us this Blessing, to make Use of for our present and
      future Happiness, and whatever was contrary to it, notwithstanding their
      School Distinctions of <i>contrary</i> and <i>above</i> Reason, must be
      false. This Reason teaches us, that there is a first Cause of all Things,
      an <i>Ens Entium</i>, which we call God, and our Reason will also suggest,
      that he must be eternal, and, as the Author of every Thing perfect, he
      must be infinitely perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      If so, he can be subject to no Passions, and neither loves nor hates; he
      must be ever the fame, and cannot rashly do to Day what he shall repent to
      Morrow. He must be perfectly happy, consequently nothing can add to an
      eternal State of Tranquillity, and though it becomes us to adore him, yet
      can our Adorations neither augment, nor our Sins take from this Happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his Arguments on this Head are too long, and too dangerous to
      translate; and as they are work'd up with great Subtlety, they may be
      pernicious to weak Men, who cannot discover their Fallacy; or, who finding
      'em agreeable to their Inclinations, and would be glad to shake off the
      Yoke of the Christian Religion, which galls and curbs their Passions,
      would not give themselves the Trouble to examine them to the Bottom, but
      give into what pleases, glad of finding some Excuse to their Consciences.
      Though as his Opinion of a future State has nothing in it which impugns
      the Christian Religion, I shall set it down in few Words.
    </p>
    <p>
      That reasoning Faculty, says he, which we perceive within us, we call the
      Soul, but what that Soul is, is unknown to us. It may die with the Body,
      or it may survive. I am of Opinion its immortal; but to say that this
      Opinion is the Dictate of Reason, or only the Prejudice of Education,
      would, I own, puzzle me. If it is immortal, it must be an Emanation from
      the Divine Being, and consequently at its being separated from the Body,
      will return to its first Principle, if not contaminated. Now, my Reason
      tells me, if it is estranged from its first Principle, which is the Deity,
      all the Hells of Man's Invention can never yield Tortures adequate to such
      a Banishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had privately held these Discourses among the Crew, he had gained a
      Number of Proselytes, who look'd upon him as a new Prophet risen up to
      reform the Abuses in Religion; and a great Number being <i>Rochellers</i>,
      and, as yet, tainted with <i>Calvinism</i>, his Doctrine was the more
      readily embrac'd. When he had experienced the Effects of his religious
      Arguments, he fell upon Government, and shew'd, that every Man was born
      free, and had as much Right to what would support him, as to the Air he
      respired. A contrary Way of arguing would be accusing the Deity with
      Cruelty and Injustice, for he brought into the World no Man to pass a Life
      of Penury, and to miserably want a necessary Support; that the vast
      Difference between Man and Man, the one wallowing in Luxury, and the other
      in the most pinching Necessity, was owing only to Avarice and Ambition on
      the one Hand, and a pusillanimous Subjection on the other; that at first
      no other than a Natural was known, a paternal Government, every Father was
      the Head, the Prince and Monarch of his Family, and Obedience to such was
      both just and easy, for a Father had a compassionate Tenderness for his
      Children; but Ambition creeping in by Degrees, the stronger Family set
      upon and enslaved the Weaker; and this additional Strength over-run a
      third, by every Conquest gathering Force to make others, and this was the
      first Foundation of Monarchy. Pride encreasing with Power, Man usurped the
      Prerogative of God, over his Creatures, that of depriving them of Life,
      which was a Privilege no one had over his own; for as he did not come into
      the World by his own Election, he ought to stay the determined Time of his
      Creator: That indeed, Death given in War, was by the Law of Nature
      allowable, because it is for the Preservation of our own Lives; but no
      Crime ought to be thus punished, nor indeed any War undertaken, but in
      Defence of our natural Right, which is such a Share of Earth as is
      necessary for our Support.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Topicks he often declaimed on, and very often advised with <i>Misson</i>
      about the setting up for themselves; he was as ambitious as the other, and
      as resolute. <i>Caraccioli</i> and <i>Misson</i> were by this expert
      Mariners, and very capable of managing a Ship: <i>Caraccioli</i> had
      founded a great many of the Men on this Subject, and found them very
      inclineable to listen to him. An Accident happen'd which gave <i>Caraccioli</i>
      a fair Opportunity to put his Designs in Execution, and he laid Hold of
      it; they went off <i>Martinico</i> on a Cruize, and met with the <i>Winchelsea</i>,
      an <i>English</i> Man of War of 40 Guns, commanded by Captain <i>Jones</i>;
      they made for each other, and a very smart Engagement followed, the first
      Broadside killed the Captain, second Captain, and the three Lieutenants,
      on Board the <i>Victoire</i> and left only the Master, who would have
      struck, but Misson took up the Sword, order'd <i>Caraccioli</i> to act as
      Lieutenant, and encouraging the Men fought the Ship six Glasses, when by
      some Accident, the <i>Winchelsea</i> blew up, and not a Man was saved but
      Lieutenant <i>Franklin</i>, whom the <i>French</i> Boats took up, and he
      died in two Days. None ever knew before this Manuscript fell into my Hands
      how the <i>Winchelsea</i> was lost; for her Head being driven ashore at <i>Antegoa</i>,
      and a great Storm having happend a few Days before her Head was found, it
      was concluded, that she founder'd in that Storm. After this Engagement, <i>Caraccioli</i>
      came to Misson and saluted him Captain, and desired to know if he would
      chuse a momentary or a lasting Command, that he must now determine, for at
      his Return to <i>Martinico</i> it would be too late; and he might depend
      upon the Ship he fought and saved being given to another, and they would
      think him well rewarded if made a Lieutenant, which Piece of Justice he
      doubted: That he had his Fortune in his Hands, which he might either keep
      or let go; if he made Choice of the latter, he must never again expect she
      would court him to accept her Favours: That he ought to let before his
      Eyes his Circumstances, as a younger Brother of a good Family, but nothing
      to support his Character; and the many Years he must serve at the Expence
      of his Blood before he could make any Figure in the World; and consider
      the wide Difference between the commanding and being commanded: That he
      might with the Ship he had under Foot, and the brave Fellows under
      Command, bid Defiance to the Power of <i>Europe</i>, enjoy every Thing he
      wish'd, reign Sovereign of the Southern Seas, and lawfully make War on all
      the World, since it would deprive him of that Liberty to which he had a
      Right by the Laws of Nature: That he might in Time, become as great as <i>Alexander</i>
      was to the <i>Persians</i>; and by encreasing his Forces by his Captures,
      he would every Day strengthen the Justice of his Cause, for who has Power
      is always in the Right. That <i>Harry</i> the Fourth and <i>Harry</i> the
      Seventh, attempted and succeeded in their Enterprizes on the Crown of <i>England</i>,
      yet their Forces did not equal his. <i>Mahomet</i> with a few Camel
      Drivers, founded the <i>Ottoman</i> Empire and <i>Darius</i>, with no more
      than six or seven Companions got Possession on of that of <i>Persia</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a Word he said so much that <i>Misson</i> resolved to follow his
      Advice, and calling up all Hands, he told them, 'That a great Number of
      them had resolved with him upon a Life of Liberty, and had done him the
      Honour to create him Chief: That he designed to force no Man, and be
      guilty of that Injustice he blamed in others; therefore, if any were
      averse to the following his Fortune, which he promised should be the same
      to all, he desired they would declare themselves, and he would set them
      ashore, whence they might return with Conveniency;' having made an End,
      they one and all cryed, <i>Vive le Capitain</i> Misson <i>et son
      Lieutenant le Seavant</i> Caraccioli, God bless Capt. <i>Misson</i> and
      his learned Lieutenant <i>Caraccioli</i>. <i>Misson</i> thanked them for
      the Honour they conferr'd upon him, and promised he would use the Power
      they gave for the publick Good only, and hoped, as they had the Bravery to
      assert their Liberty, they would be as unanimous in the preserving it, and
      stand by him in what should be found expedient for the Good of all; that
      he was their Friend and Companion, and should never exert his Power, or
      think himself other than their Comrade, but when the Necessity of Affairs
      should oblige him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They shouted a second Time, <i>vive le Capitain</i>; he, after this,
      desired they would chuse their subaltern Officers, and give them Power to
      consult and conclude upon what might be for the common Interest, and bind
      themselves down by an Oath to agree to what such Officers and he should
      determine: This they readily gave into. The School-Master they chose for
      second Lieutenant, <i>Jean Besace</i> they nominated for third, and the
      Boatswain, and a Quarter-Master, named <i>Matthieu le Tondu</i>, with the
      Gunner, they desired might be their Representatives in Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Choice was approved, and that every Thing might pass methodically, and
      with general Approbation, they were called into the great Cabbin, and the
      Question put, what Course they should steer? The Captain proposed the <i>Spanish</i>
      Coast as the most probable to afford them rich Prizes: This was agreed
      upon by all. The Boatswain then asked what Colours they should fight
      under, and advised Black as most terrifying; but <i>Caraccioli</i>
      objected, that they were no Pyrates, but Men who were resolved to assert
      that Liberty which God and Nature gave them, and own no Subjection to any,
      farther than was for the common Good of all: That indeed, Obedience to
      Governors was necessary, when they knew and acted up to the Duty of their
      Function; were vigilant Guardians of the Peoples Rights and Liberties; saw
      that Justice was equally distributed; were Barriers against the Rich and
      Powerful, when they attempted to oppress the Weaker; when they suffered
      none of the one Hand to grow immensely rich, either by his own or his
      Ancestors Encroachments; nor on the other, any to be wretchedly miserable,
      either by falling into the Hands of Villains, unmerciful Creditors, or
      other Misfortunes. While he had Eyes impartial, and allowed nothing but
      Merit to distinguish between Man and Man; and instead of being a Burthen
      to the People by his luxurious life, he was by his Care for, and
      Protection of them, a real Father, and in every Thing acted with the equal
      and impartial Justice of a Parent: But when a Governor, who is the
      Minister of the People, thinks himself rais'd to this Dignity, that he may
      spend his Days in Pomp and Luxury, looking upon his Subjects as so many
      Slaves, created for his Use and Pleasure, and therefore leaves them and
      their Affairs to the immeasurable Avarice and Tyranny of some one whom he
      has chosen for his Favourite, when nothing but Oppression, Poverty, and
      all the Miseries of Life flow from such an Administration; that he
      lavishes away the Lives and Fortunes of the People, either to gratify his
      Ambition, or to support the Cause of some neighbouring Prince, that he may
      in Return, strengthen his Hands should his People exert themselves in
      Defence of their native Rights; or should he run into unnecessary Wars, by
      the rash and thoughtless Councils of his Favourite, and not able to make
      Head against the Enemy he has rashly or wantonly brought upon his Hands,
      and buy a Peace (which is the present Case of <i>France</i>, as every one
      knows, by supporting King <i>James</i>, and afterwards proclaiming his
      Son) and drain the Subject; should the Peoples Trade be wilfully
      neglected, for private Interests, and while their Ships of War lie idle in
      their Harbours, suffer their Vessels to be taken; and the Enemy not only
      intercepts all Commerce, but insults their Coasts: It speaks a generous
      and great Soul to shake off the Yoak; and if we cannot redress our Wrongs,
      withdraw from sharing the Miseries which meaner Spirits submit to, and
      scorn to yield to the Tyranny. Such Men are we, and, if the World, as
      Experience may convince us it will, makes War upon us, the Law of Nature
      empowers us not only to be on the defensive, but also on the offensive
      Part. As we then do not proceed upon the same Ground with Pyrates, who are
      Men of dissolute Lives and no Principles, let us scorn to take their
      Colours: Ours is a brave, a just, an innocent, and a noble Cause; the
      Cause of Liberty. I therefore advise a white Ensign, with Liberty painted
      in the Fly, and if you like the Motto, <i>a Deo a Libertate</i>, for God
      and Liberty, as an Emblem of our Uprightness and Resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cabbin Door was left open, and the Bulk Head which was of Canvas
      rowled up, the Steerage being full of Men, who lent an attentive Ear, they
      cried, <i>Liberty, Liberty; we are free Men</i>: Vive <i>the brave Captain</i>
      Misson <i>and the noble Lieutenant</i> Caraccioli. This short Council
      breaking up, every Thing belonging to the deceased Captain, and the other
      Officers, and Men lost in the Engagement, was brought upon Deck and
      over-hawled; the Money ordered to be put into a Chest, and the Carpenter
      to clap on a Padlock for, and give a Key to, every one of the Council:
      Misson telling them, all should be in common, and the particular Avarice
      of no one should defraud the Publick.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Plate Monsieur <i>Fourbin</i> had, was going to the Chest, the
      Men unanimously cried out avast, keep that out for the Captain's Use, as a
      Present from his Officers and Fore-mast Men. <i>Misson</i> thanked them,
      the Plate was returned to the great Cabbin, and the Chest secured
      according to Orders: Misson then ordered his Lieutenants and other
      Officers to examine who among the Men, were in most Want of Cloaths, and
      to distribute those of the dead Men impartially, which was done with a
      general Content and Applause of the whole Crew: All but the wounded being
      upon Deck. <i>Misson</i> from the Baracade, spoke to the following
      Purpose, 'That since they had unanimously resolved to seize upon and
      defend their Liberty, which ambitious Men had usurped, and that this could
      not be esteemed by impartial Judges other than a just and brave
      Resolution, he was under an Obligation to recommend to them a brotherly
      Love to each other; the Banishment of all private Piques and Grudges, and
      a swift Agreement and Harmony among themselves: That in throwing off the
      Yoak of Tyranny of which the Action spoke an Abhorrence, he hoped none
      would follow the Example of Tyrants, and turn his Back upon Justice; for
      when Equity was trodden under Foot, Misery, Confusion, and mutual Distrust
      naturally followed.'&mdash;He also advised them to remember there was a
      Supream; the Adoration of which, Reason and Gratitude prompted us, and our
      own Interests would engage us (as it is best to be of the surest Side, and
      after-Life was allowed possible) to conciliate.&mdash;That he was
      satisfied Men who were born and bred in Slavery, by which their Spirits
      were broke, and were incapable of so generous a Way of thinking, who,
      ignorant of their Birth-Right, and the Sweets of Liberty, dance to the
      Musick of their Chains, which was, indeed, the greater Part of the
      Inhabitants of the Globe, would brand this generous Crew with the
      insidious Name of Pyrates, and think it meritorious, to be instrumental in
      their Destruction.&mdash;Self-Preservation therefore, and not a cruel
      Disposition, obliged him to declare War against all such as should refuse
      him the Entry of their Ports, and against all, who should not immediately
      surrender and give up what their Necessities required; but in a more
      particular Manner against all <i>European</i> Ships and Vessels, as
      concluded implacable Enemies. <i>And I do now,</i> said he, <i>declare
      such War, and, at the same time, recommend to you my Comrades a humane and
      generous Behaviour towards your Prisoners; which will appear by so much
      more the Effects of a noble Soul, as we are satisfied we should not meet
      the same Treatment should our ill Fortune, or more properly our Disunion,
      or want of Courage, give us up to their Mercy.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, he required a Muster should be made, and there were able Hands
      two Hundred, and thirty five sick and wounded; as they were muster'd they
      were sworn. After Affairs were thus settled, they shaped their Course the
      <i>Spanish West-Indies,</i> but resolved, in the Way, to take a Week or
      ten Days Cruize in the Windward Passage from <i>Jamaica,</i> because most
      Merchant Men, which were good Sailors and did not slay for Convoy, took
      this as the shorter Cut for <i>England.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Off St. <i>Christophers</i> they took an <i>English</i> Sloop becalmed,
      with their Boats; they took out of her a couple of Puncheons of Rum, and
      half a dozen Hogsheads of Sugar (she was a <i>New England</i> Sloop, bound
      for <i>Boston</i>) and without offering the least Violence to the Men, or
      stripping them, they let her go. The Master of the Sloop was <i>Thomas
      Butler,</i> who owned, he never met with so candid an Enemy as the <i>French</i>
      Man of War, which took him the Day he left St. <i>Christophers;</i> they
      met with no other Booty in their Way, till they came upon their Station,
      when after three Days, they saw a Sloop which had the Impudence to give
      them Chace; Captain <i>Misson</i> asked what could be the Meaning that the
      Sloop stood for them? One of the Men, who was acquainted with the <i>West-Indies,</i>
      told him, it was a <i>Jamaica</i> Privateer, and he should not wonder, if
      he clapp'd him aboard. I am, said he, no Stranger to their Way of working,
      and this despicable Fellow, as those who don't know a <i>Jamaica</i>
      Privateer may think him, it is ten to one will give you some Trouble. It
      now grows towards Evening, and you'll find as soon as he has discovered
      your Force, he'll keep out of the Reach of your Guns till the 12 a-Clock
      Watch is changed at Night, and he'll then attempt to clap you aboard, with
      Hopes to carry you in the Hurry: Wherefore Captain, if you will give me
      Leave to advise you, let every Man have his small Arms; and at twelve, let
      the Bell ring as usual; and rather more Noise than ordinary be made, as if
      the one Watch was turning in, and the other out, in a Confusion and Hurry,
      and I'll engage he will venture to enter his Men. The Fellow's Advice was
      approved and resolved upon, and the Sloop work'd, as he said she would,
      for upon coming near enough to make distinctly the Force of the <i>Victoire</i>,
      on her throwing out <i>French</i> Colours, she, the Sloop, clapp'd upon a
      Wind, the <i>Victoire</i> gave Chace, but without Hopes of gaining upon
      her; she went so well to Windward, that she cou'd spare the Ship some
      Points in her Sheet, and yet wrong her: At Dusk of the Even, the <i>French</i>
      had lost Sight of her, but about Eleven at Night, they saw her hankering
      up their Windward Bow, which confirmed the Sailors Opinion, that she would
      attempt to board them, as she did at the pretended Change of the Watch;
      there being little or no Wind, she lashed to the Bow-Sprit of the <i>Victoire</i>
      and enter'd her Men, who were very quietly taken, as they enter'd and
      tumbled down the Forehatch, where they were received by others, and bound
      without Noise, not one of the Privateers killed, few hurt, and only one <i>Frenchman</i>
      wounded. The <i>Victoire</i> the better Part of the Sloop's Men secured,
      they boarded in their Turn, when the Privateer's suspecting some
      Stratagem, were endeavouring to cut their Lashing and get off:
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Englishman caught a Tartar. The Prisoners being all secured, the
      Captain charged his Men not to discover, thro' a Desire of augmenting
      their Number, the Account they were upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next Morning Monsieur <i>Misson</i> called for the Captain of the
      Privateer, he told him, he could not but allow him a brave Fellow, to
      venture upon a Ship of his Countenance, and for that Reason he should meet
      Treatment which Men of his Profession seldom afforded the Prisoners they
      made. He asked him how long he had been out, what was his Name, and what
      he had on Board? He answered he was but just come out, that he was the
      first Sail he had met with, and should have thought himself altogether as
      lucky not to have spoke with him' that his Name was <i>Harry Ramsey</i>,
      and what he had on Board were Rags, Powder, Ball, and some few half
      Anchors of Rum. <i>Ramsey</i> was ordered into the Gun-Room, and a Council
      being held in the publick Manner aforesaid, the Bulk Head of the great
      Cabbin rowled up. On their Conclusion, the Captain of the Privateer was
      called in again, when Captain <i>Misson</i> told him, he would return him
      his Sloop, and restore him and his Men to their Liberty, without stripping
      or plundering of any Thing, but what Prudence obliged him to, their
      Ammunition and Small-Arms, if he would give him his Word and Honour, and
      his Men to take an Oath, not to go out on the Privateer Account in six
      Months after they left him: That he did not design to continue that
      Station above a Week longer, at the Expiration of which Time he would let
      them go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ramsey</i>, who had a new Sloop, did not expect this Favour, which he
      thanked him for, and promised punctually to comply with the Injunction,
      which his Men as readily swore to, tho' they had no Design to keep the
      Oath. The Time being expired, he and his Men were put on Board their own
      Sloop. At going over the Ship's Side <i>Ramsey</i> begg'd Monsieur <i>Misson</i>
      would allow him Powder for a salute, by way of Thanks; but he answered
      him, the Ceremony was needless, and he expected no other Return than that
      of keeping his Word, which indeed <i>Ramsey</i> did. Some of his Men had
      found it more to their Advantage to have been as religious.
    </p>
    <p>
      At parting Ramsey gave the Ship three Chears, and <i>Misson</i> had the
      Complaisance to return one, which <i>Ramsey</i> answering with three more,
      made the best of his Way for <i>Jamaica</i>, and at the East End of the
      Island met with the <i>Diana</i>, who, upon Advice, turn'd back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Victoire</i> steer'd for <i>Carthagene</i>, off which Port they
      cruised some Days, but meeting with nothing in the Seas, they made for <i>Porto
      Bello</i>; in their Way they met with two <i>Dutch</i> Traders, who had
      Letters of Mart, and were just come upon the Coast, the one had 20, the
      other 24 Guns; <i>Misson</i> engaged them, and they defended themselves
      with a great Deal of Resolution and Gallantry; and as they were mann'd a
      Peak, he darst not venture to board either of them, for fear of being at
      the same Time boarded by the other. His Weight of Mettal gave him a great
      Advantage over the <i>Dutch</i>, though they were two to one; besides,
      their Business, as they had Cargoes, was to get off, if possible,
      wherefore they made a running Fight, though they took Care to stick close
      to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      They maintained the Fight for above six Hours, when <i>Misson</i>, enraged
      at this Obstinacy, and fearing, if by Accident they should bring a Mast,
      or Top-Mast, by the board, they would get from him. He was resolved to
      sink the larger Ship of the two, and accordingly ordered his Men to bring
      all their Guns to bear a Midship, then running close along Side of him, to
      raise their Mettal; his Orders being punctually obey'd, he pour'd in a
      Broad Side, which open'd such a Gap in the <i>Dutch</i> Ship, that she
      went directly to the Bottom, and every Man perish'd.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then mann'd his Bowsprit, brought his Sprit-sail Yard fore and aft, and
      resolved to board the other, which the <i>Dutch</i> perceiving, and
      terrified with the unhappy Fate of their Comrade, thought a farther
      Resistance vain, and immediately struck. <i>Misson</i> gave them good
      Quarters, though he was enraged at the Loss of 13 Men killed outright,
      beside 9 wounded, of which 6 died. They found on board a great Quantity of
      Gold and Silver Lace, brocade Silks, Silk Stockings, Bails of
      Broad-Cloath, bazes of all Colours, and <i>Osnabrughs</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Consultation being held, it was resolved Captain <i>Misson</i> should
      take the Name of <i>Fourbin</i>, and returning to <i>Carthagene</i>,
      dispose of his Prize, and set his Prisoners ashoar. Accordingly they ply'd
      to the Eastward, and came to an Anchor between <i>Boca Chieca</i> Fort,
      and the Town, for they did not think it expedient to enter the Harbour.
      The Barge was manned, and <i>Caraccioli</i>, with the Name of <i>D'Aubigny</i>,
      the first lieutenant, who was killed in the Engagement with the <i>Winchelsea</i>,
      and his Commission in his Pocket, went ashore with a Letter to the
      Governor, sign'd <i>Fourbin</i>, whose Character, for fear of the worst,
      was exactly counterfeited. The Purport of his Letter was, that having
      discretionary Orders to cruize for three Months, and hearing the <i>English</i>
      infested his Coast, he was come in search of 'em, and had met two <i>Dutch</i>
      Men, one of which he had sunk, the other he made Prize of. That his
      limited Time being near expired, he should be obliged to his Excellency,
      if he would send on board him such Merchants as were willing to take the
      Ship and Cargoe off his Hands, of which he had lent the <i>Dutch</i>
      Invoice. Don <i>Joseph de la Zerda</i>, the then Governor, received the
      Lieutenant (who sent back the Barge at landing) very civilly, and agreed
      to take the Prisoners ashoar, and do every Thing was required of him; and
      ordering fresh Provisions and Sallading to be got ready as a Present for
      the Captain, he sent for some Merchants who were very ready to go on
      board, and agree for the Ship and Goods; which they did, for two and fifty
      thousand Pieces of Eight. The next Day the Prisoners were set ashoar; a
      rich Piece of Brocade which was reserv'd, sent to the Governor for a
      Present, a Quantity of fresh Provision bought and brought on board, the
      Money paid by the Merchants, the Ship and Goods deliver'd, and the <i>Victoire</i>,
      at the Dawn of the following Day, got under Sail. It may be wonder'd how
      such Dispatch could be made, but the Reader must take Notice, these Goods
      were sold by the <i>Dutch</i> Invoice, which the Merchant of the Prize
      affirmed was genuine. I shall observe, by the by, that the <i>Victoire</i>
      was the <i>French</i> Man of War which Admiral <i>Wager</i> sent the <i>Kingston</i>
      in search of, and being afterwards falsly inform'd, that she was join'd by
      another of seventy Guns; and that they cruiz'd together between the Capes,
      order'd the <i>Severn</i> up to Windward, to assist the <i>Kingston</i>,
      which had like to have prov'd very fatal; for these two <i>English</i> Men
      of War, commanded by Captain <i>Trevor</i> and Captain <i>Padnor</i>,
      meeting in the Night, had prepared to engage, each taking the other for
      the Enemy. The <i>Kingston's</i> Men not having a good Look-out, which
      must be attributed to the Negligence of the Officer of the Watch, did not
      see the <i>Severn</i> till she was just upon them; but, by good Luck, to
      Leeward, and plying up, with all the Sail she could crowd, and a clear
      Ship. This put the <i>Kingston</i> in such Confusion, that when the <i>Severn</i>
      hal'd, no answer was retun'd, for none heard her. She was got under the <i>Kingston's</i>
      Stern, and Captain <i>Padnor</i> ordered to hale for the third and last
      Time, and if no answer was return'd, to give her a Broadside. The Noise
      onboard the <i>Kingston</i> was now a little ceas'd, and Captain Trevor,
      who was on the poop with a speaking Trumpet to hale the <i>Severn</i>, by
      good Luck heard her hale him, answering the <i>Kingston</i>, and asking
      the Name of the other ship, prevented the Damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      They cruised together some time, and meeting nothing which answer'd their
      Information, return'd to <i>Jamaica</i>, as I shall to my Subject, begging
      Pardon for this, as I thought, necessary Digression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don <i>Juan de la Zevda</i> told the Captain in a Letter, that the St. <i>Joseph</i>,
      a Gallion of seventy Guns, was then lying at <i>Port a Bello</i>, and
      should be glad he could keep her Company till she was off the Coast. That
      she would sail in eight or ten Days for the <i>Havana</i>; and that, if
      his Time would permit him, he would send an Advice-Boat. That she had on
      board the Value of 800,000 Pieces of Eight in Silver and Bar Gold. <i>Misson</i>
      return'd Answer, that he believ'd he should be excus'd if he stretched his
      Orders, for a few Days; and that he would cruize off the Isle of <i>Pearls</i>,
      and Cape <i>Gratias a Dios</i>, and give for Signal to the Gallion, his
      spreading a white Ensign in his Fore-Top-Mast Shrouds, the cluing up his
      Fore-sail, and the firing one Gun to Windward, and two to Leeward, which
      he should answer by letting run and hoisting his Fore-Top-Sail three
      times, and the firing as many Guns to Leeward. Don <i>Joseph</i>,
      extreamly pleased with this Complaisance, sent a Boat express to advise
      the St. <i>Joseph</i>, but she was already sailed two Days, contrary to
      the Governor of <i>Carthagene's</i> Expectation, and, this Advice Captain
      <i>Misson</i> had from the Boat, which returning with an Answer, saw the
      <i>Victoire</i> in the Offin, and spoke to her. It was then resolved to
      follow the <i>St. Joseph</i>, and accordingly they steer'd for the <i>Havanna</i>,
      but by what Accident they did not overtake her is unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      I forgot to tell my Reader, on Board the <i>Dutch</i> Ship were fourteen
      <i>French</i> Hugonots, whom <i>Misson</i> thought fit to detain, when
      they were at Sea. <i>Misson</i> called 'em up, and proposed to 'em their
      taking on; telling them at the same Time, he left it to their Choice, for
      he would have no forc'd Men; and that if they all, or any of them,
      disapproved the Proposal, he would either give 'em the first Vessel he met
      that was fit for 'em, or set 'em ashoar on some inhabited Coast; and
      therefore bid 'em take two Days for Consideration before they returned an
      Answer; and, to encourage 'em, he called all Hands up, and declar'd, that
      if any Man repented him of the Course of Life he had chosen, his just
      Dividend should be counted to him, and he would set him on Shoar, either
      near the <i>Havanna</i>, or some other convenient Place; but not one
      accepted the Offer, and the fourteen Prisoners unanimously resolved to
      join in with 'em; to which Resolution, no doubt, the Hopes of a good Booty
      from the <i>St. Joseph</i>, and this Offer of Liberty greatly contributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Entrance of the Gulph they spied and came with a large Merchant
      Ship bound for <i>London</i> from <i>Jamaica</i>; she had 20 Guns, but no
      more than 32 Hands, that its not to be wonder'd at she made no Resistance,
      besides, she was deep laden with Sugars. Monsieur <i>Misson</i> took out
      of her what Ammunition she had, about four thousand Pieces of Eight, some
      Puncheons of Rum, and ten Hogsheads of Sugar; and, without doing her any
      further Damage, let her proceed her Voyage. What he valued most in this
      Prize was the Men he got, for she was carrying to <i>Europe</i> twelve <i>French</i>
      Prisoners, two of which were necessary Hands, being a Carpenter and his
      Mate. They were of <i>Bourdeaux</i>, from whence they came with the <i>Pomechatraine</i>,
      which was taken by the <i>Maremaid</i> off <i>Petit Guavers</i>, after an
      obstinate Resistance, in which they lost forty Men; but they were of
      Opinion the <i>Maremaid</i> could not have taken 'em, having but four Guns
      less than she had, which was made amends for, by their having about thirty
      Hands. On the contrary, had not the <i>Guernsey</i> come up, they thought
      of boarding and carrying the <i>Maremaid</i>. These Men very willingly
      came into Captain <i>Misson's</i> Measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Men, who had been stripp'd to the Skin, begg'd Leave to make
      Reprisals, but the Captain would not suffer them, though he told the
      Master of the Prize, as he protected him and his Men, he thought it
      reasonable these <i>French</i> should be cloathed: Upon this the Master
      contributed of his own, and every Man bringing up his Chest, thought
      themselves very well off in sharing with them one half.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though <i>Misson's</i> Ship pass'd for a <i>French</i> Man of War, yet his
      Generosity in letting the Prize go, gave the <i>English</i> Grounds to
      suspect the Truth, neither the Ship nor Cargoe being of Use to such as
      were upon the grand Account.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had lost all Hopes of the St. <i>Joseph</i>, they coasted along
      the North-Side of <i>Cuba</i>, and the <i>Victoire</i> growing now foul,
      they ran into a Landlock'd Bay on the East North-East Point, where they
      hove her down by Boats and Guns, though they could not pretend to heave
      her Keel out; however, they scraped and tallowed as far as they could go;
      they, for this Reason, many of them repented they had let the last Prize
      go, by which they might have careened.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had righted the Ship, and put every Thing on Board, they
      consulted upon the Course they should steer. Upon this the Council
      divided. The Captain and <i>Caraccioli</i> were for stretching over to the
      <i>African</i>, and the others for the <i>New-England</i> Coast,
      alledging, that the Ship had a foul Bottom, and was not fit for the
      Voyage; and that if they met with contrary Winds, and bad Weather, their
      Stock of Provision might fall short; and that as they were not far from
      the <i>English</i> Settlement of <i>Carolina</i>, they might either on
      that or the Coast of <i>Virginia, Maryland, Pensylvania, New-York</i>, or
      <i>New-England</i>, intercept ships which traded to the Islands with
      Provisions, and by that Means provide themselves with Bread, Flower, and
      other Necessaries. An Account of the Provisions were taken, and finding
      they had Provisions for four Months. Captain <i>Misson</i> called all
      Hands upon Deck, and told them, as the Council differed in the Course they
      should steer, he thought it reasonable to have it put to the Vote of the
      whole Company. That for his Part, he was for going to the Coast of <i>Guiney</i>,
      where they might reasonably expect to meet with valuable Prizes; but
      should they fail in their Expectation one Way, they would be sure of
      having it answered another; for they could then throw themselves in that
      of the <i>East-India</i> Ships, and he need not tell them, that the
      outward bound dreined <i>Europe</i> of what Money they drew from America.
      He then gave the Sentiments of those who were against him, and their
      Reasons, and begg'd that every one would give his Opinion and Vote
      according as he thought most conducive to the Good of all. That he should
      be far from taking it ill if they should reject what he had proposed,
      since he had no private Views to serve. The Majority of Votes fell on the
      Captain's Side, and they accordingly shaped their Course for the Coast of
      Guiney, in which Voyage nothing remarkable happened. On their Arrival on
      the Gold-Coast, they fell in with the <i>Nieuwstadt</i> of <i>Amsterdam</i>,
      a Ship of 18 Guns, commanded by Capt. <i>Blacs</i>, who made a running
      Fight of five Glasses: This Ship they kept with them, putting on Board 40
      Hands, and bringing all the Prisoners on Board the <i>Victoire</i>, they
      were Forty three in Number, they left <i>Amsterdam</i> with Fifty six,
      seven were killed in the Engagement, and they had lost six by Sickness and
      Accidents, one falling overboard, and one being taken by a Shark going
      overboard in a Calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Nieuwstadt</i> had some Gold-Dust on Board, to the Value of about
      2000 l. Sterling, and a few Slaves to the Number of Seventeen, for she had
      but begun to Trade; the Slaves were a strengthening of their Hands, for
      the Captain order'd them to be cloathed out of Dutch Mariners Chests, and
      told his Men, 'That the Trading for those of our own Species, cou'd never
      be agreeable to the Eyes of divine Justice: That no Man had Power or the
      Liberty of another; and while those who profess'd a more enlightened
      Knowledge of the Deity, sold Men like Beasts; they prov'd that their
      Religion was no more than Grimace, and that they differ'd from the <i>Barbarians</i>
      in Name only, since their Practice was in nothing more humane: For his
      Part, and he hop'd, he spoke the Sentiments of all his brave Companions,
      he had not exempted his Neck from the galling Yoak of Slavery, and
      asserted his own Liberty, to enslave others. That however, these Men were
      distinguish'd from the <i>Europeans</i> by their Colour, Customs, or
      religious Rites, they were the Work of the same omnipotent Being, and
      endued with equal Reason: Wherefore, he desired they might be treated like
      Freemen (for he wou'd banish even the Name of Slavery from among them)'
      and divided into Messes among them, to the End they might the sooner learn
      their Language, be sensible of the Obligation they had to them, and more
      capable and zealous to defend that Liberty they owed to their Justice and
      Humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Speech of <i>Misson</i>'s was received with general Applause, and the
      Ship rang with <i>vive le Capitain</i> Misson. Long live Capt. <i>Misson</i>.&mdash;The
      Negroes were divided among the <i>French</i>, one to a Mess, who, by their
      Gesticulations, shew'd they were gratefully sensible of their being
      delivered from their Chains. Their Ship growing very foul, and going
      heavily through the Water, they run into the River of <i>Lagoa</i>, where
      they hove her down, taking out such Planks as had suffer'd most by the
      Worms, and substituting new in their Room.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this they careened the Prize, and so put out to Sea, steering to the
      Southward, and keeping along the Coast, but met with Nothing. All this
      while, the greatest Decorum and Regularity was observed on Board the <i>Victoire</i>;
      but the <i>Dutch</i> Prisoners Example began to lead 'em into Swearing and
      Drunkenness, which the Captain remarking, thought it was best to nip these
      Vices in the Bud; and calling both the <i>French</i> and <i>Dutch</i> upon
      Deck, he address'd himself to the former, desiring their Captain, who
      spoke French excellently well, to interpret what he said to those who did
      not understand him. He told them, 'before he had the Misfortune of having
      them on Board, his Ears were never grated with hearing the Name of the
      great Creator prophaned, tho' he, to his Sorrow, had often since heard his
      own Men guilty of that Sin, which administer'd neither Profit nor
      Pleasure, and might draw upon them a severe Punishment: That if they had a
      just Idea of that great Being, they wou'd never mention him, but they
      wou'd immediately reflect on his Purity and their own Vileness. That we so
      easily took Impression from our Company, that the <i>Spanish</i> Proverb
      says, <i>let a Hermit and a Thief live together, the Thief wou'd become
      Hermit, or the Hermit Thief</i>: That he saw this verified in his Ship,
      for he cou'd attribute the Oaths and Curses he had heard among his brave
      Companions, to nothing but the odious Example of the <i>Dutch</i>: That
      this was not the only Vice they had introduced, for before they were on
      Board, his Men were Men, but he found by their beastly Pattern they were
      degenerated into Brutes, by drowning that only Faculty, which
      distinguishes between Man and Beast, <i>Reason</i>. That as he had the
      Honour to command them, he could not see them run into these odious Vices
      without, a sincere Concern, as he had a paternal Affection for them; and
      he should reproach himself as neglectful of the common Good, if he did not
      admonish them; and as by the Post which they had honour'd him, he was
      obliged to have a watchful Eye over their general Interest; he was obliged
      to tell them his Sentiments were, that the <i>Dutch</i> allured them to a
      dissolute Way of Life, that they might take some Advantage over them:
      Wherefore, as his brave Companions, he was assured, wou'd be guided by
      Reason, he gave the <i>Dutch</i> Notice, that the first whom he catch'd
      either with an Oath in his Mouth or Liquor in his Head, should be brought
      to the Geers, whipped and pickled, for an Example to the rest of his
      Nation: As to his Friends, his Companions, his Children, those gallant,
      those generous, noble, and heroick Souls he had the Honour to command, he
      entreated them to allow a small Time for Reflection, and to consider how
      little Pleasure sure, and how much Danger, might flow from imitating the
      Vices of their Enemies; and that they would among themselves, make a Law
      for the Suppression of what would otherwise estrange them from the Source
      of Life, and consequently leave them destitute of his Protection.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not to be imagined what Efficacy this Speech had on both Nations:
      The <i>Dutch</i> grew continent in Fear of Punishment, and the <i>French</i>
      in Fear of being reproach'd by their good Captain, for they never
      mentioned him without this Epithet. Upon the Coast of <i>Angola</i>, they
      met with a second Dutch Ship, the Cargo of which consisted of Silk and
      Woolen Stuffs, Cloath, Lace, Wine, Brandy, Oyl, Spice, and hard Ware; the
      Prize gave Chase and engaged her, but upon the coming up of the <i>Victoire</i>
      she struck. This Ship opportunely came in their Way, and gave full Employ
      to the Taylors, who were on Board, for the whole Crew began to be out at
      Elbows: They plundered her of what was of Use to their own Ship, and then
      sunk her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain having about ninety Prisoners on Board, proposed the giving
      them the Prize, with what was necessary for their Voyage, and sending them
      away; which being agreed to, they shifted her Ammunition on Board the <i>Victoire</i>,
      and giving them Provision to carry them to the Settlements the Dutch have
      on the Coast, <i>Misson</i> called them up, told them what was his Design,
      and ask'd if any of them was willing to share his Fortune: Eleven <i>Dutch</i>
      came into him, two of which were Sail-makers, one an Armourer, and one a
      Carpenter, necessary Hands; the rest he let go, not a little surprised at
      the Regularity, Tranquillity, and Humanity, which they found among these
      new fashioned Pyrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now run the Length of <i>Soldinia</i> Bay about ten Leagues to
      the Northward of <i>Table</i> Bay. As here is good Water, safe Riding,
      plenty of Fish and fresh Provision, to be got of the Natives for the
      Merchandize they had on Board, it was resolved to stay here some little
      Time for Refreshments. When they had the Bay open, they spied a tall Ship,
      which instantly got under sail, and hove out <i>English</i> Colours. The
      <i>Victoire</i> made a clear Ship, and hove out her <i>French</i> Ensign,
      and a smart Engagement began. <i>The English</i> was a new Ship built for
      40 Guns, though she had but 32 mounted, and 90 Hands. <i>Misson</i> gave
      Orders for boarding, and his Number of fresh Men he constantly poured in,
      after an obstinate Dispute obliged the <i>English</i> to fly the Decks,
      and leave the <i>French</i> Masters of their Ship, who promised, and gave
      them, good Quarters, and stripp'd not a Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found on Board the Prize some Bales of <i>English</i> Broad-Cloath,
      and about 60000 l. in <i>English</i> Crown Pieces, and <i>Spanish</i>
      Pieces of Eight. The <i>English</i> Captain was killed in the Engagement,
      and 14 of his Men: The <i>French</i> lost 12, which was no small
      Mortification, but did not, however provoke them to use their Prisoners
      harshly. Captain <i>Misson</i> was sorry for the Death of the Commander,
      whom he buried on the Shoar, and one of his Men being a Stone-Cutter, he
      raised a Stone over his Grave with these Words, <i>Icy gist un brave
      Anglois</i>, Here lies a gallant <i>English</i> Man; when he was buried he
      made a tripple Discharge of 50 small Arms, and fired Minute Guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>English</i>, knowing whose Hands they were fallen into, charm'd
      with <i>Misson</i>'s Humanity, 30 of them, in 3 Days Space, desired to
      take on with him. He accepted 'em, but at the same Time gave 'em to
      understand, that in taking on with him they were not to expect they should
      be indulged in a dissolute and immoral Life. He now divided his Company
      between the two Ships, and made <i>Caraccioli</i> Captain of the Prize,
      giving him Officers chosen by the publick Suffrage. The 17 Negroes began
      to understand a little <i>French</i>, and to be useful Hands, and in less
      than a Month all the <i>English</i> Prisoners came over to him, except
      their Officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had two Ships well mann'd with resolute Fellows; they now doubled the
      Cape, and made the South End of <i>Madagascar</i>, and one of the <i>English</i>
      Men telling Captain <i>Misson</i>, that the <i>European</i> Ships bound
      for <i>Surat</i> commonly touch'd at the Island of <i>Johanna</i>, he sent
      for Captain <i>Caracciola</i> on Board, and it was agreed to cruise off
      that Island. They accordingly sailed on the West-Side of <i>Madagascar</i>
      and off the Bay <i>de Diego</i>. About half Seas over between that Bay and
      the Island of <i>Johanna</i>, they came up with an <i>English East-India</i>
      Man, which made Signals of Distress as soon as she spy'd <i>Misson</i> and
      his Prize; they found her sinking by an unexpected Leak, and took all her
      Men on Board, though they could get little out of her before she went
      down. The <i>English</i>, who were thus miraculously saved from perishing,
      desired to be set on Shoar at <i>Johanna</i>, where they hop'd to meet
      with either a <i>Dutch</i> or <i>English</i> Ship in a little Time, and
      the mean while they were sure of Relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at Johanna, and were kindly received by the Queen-Regent and
      her Brother, on account of the <i>English</i> on the one Hand, and of
      their Strength on the other, which the Queen's Brother, who had the
      Administration of Affairs, was not able to make Head against, and hoped
      they might assist him against the King of <i>Mohila</i>, who threaten'd
      him with a Visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an Island which is contiguous, in a manner, to <i>Johanna</i>, and
      lies about N. W. and by N. from it. <i>Caraccioli</i> told <i>Misson</i>
      he might make his Advantage in widening the Breach between these two
      little Monarchies, and, by offering his Assistance to that of <i>Johanna</i>,
      in a manner rule both, For these would count him as their Protector, and
      those come to any Terms to buy his Friendship, by which Means he would
      hold the Ballance of Power between them. He followed this Advice, and
      offered his Friendship and Assistance to the Queen, who very readily
      embraced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must advise the Reader, that many of this Island speak <i>English</i>,
      and that the <i>English</i> Men who were of <i>Misson's</i> Crew, and his
      Interpreters, told them, their Captain, though not an <i>Englishman</i>,
      was their Friend and Ally, and a Friend and Brother to the <i>Johanna</i>
      Men, for they esteem the <i>English</i> beyond all other Nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were supplied by the Queen with all Necessaries of Life, and <i>Misson</i>
      married her Sister, as <i>Caraccioli</i> did the Daughter of her Brother,
      whose Armory, which consisted before of no more than two rusty Fire-Locks,
      and three Pistols, he furnish'd with thirty Fuzils, as many Pair of
      Pistols, and gave him two Barrels of Powder, and four of Ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of his Men took Wives, and some requited their Share of the
      Prizes, which was justly given them, they designing to settle in this
      Island, but the Number of these did not exceed ten, which Loss was
      repaired by thirty of the Crew (they had saved from perishing) coming in
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they past their Time in all manner of Diversions the Place would
      afford them, as hunting, feasting, and visiting the Island, the King of <i>Mohila</i>
      made a Descent, and alarm'd the whole Country. <i>Misson</i> advised the
      Queen's Brother not to give him any Impediment, but let him get into the
      Heart of the Island, and he would take Care to intercept their Return; but
      the Prince answered, should he follow his Advice the Enemy would do him
      and the Subjects an irreparable Damage, in destroying the Cocoa Walks, and
      for that Reason he must endeavour to stop his Progress. Upon this Answer
      he asked the <i>English</i> who were not under his Command, if they were
      willing to join him in repelling the Enemies of their common Host, and one
      and all consenting, he gave them Arms, and mixed them with his own Men,
      and about the same Number of <i>Johannians</i>, under the Command of <i>Caraccioli</i>
      and the Queen's Brother, and arming out all his Boats, he went himself to
      the Westward of the Island, where they made their Descent. The Party which
      went by Land, fell in with, and beat the <i>Mohilians</i> with great Ease,
      who were in the greatest Consternation, to find their Retreat cut off by
      <i>Misson</i>'s Boats. The <i>Johannians</i>, whom they had often
      molested, were so enraged, that they gave Quarter to none, and out of 300
      who made the Descent, if <i>Misson</i> and <i>Caraccioli</i> had not
      interposed, not a Soul had escaped; 113 were taken Prisoners by his Men,
      and carried on Board his Ships. These he sent fate to <i>Mohila</i>, with
      a Message to the King, to desire he would make Peace with his Friend and
      Ally the King of <i>Johanna</i>; but that Prince, little affected with the
      Service done him in the Preservation of his Subjects, sent him Word he
      took Laws from none, and knew when to make War and Peace without his
      Advice, which he neither asked nor wanted. <i>Misson</i>, irritated by
      this rude Answer, resolved to transfer the War into his own Country, and
      accordingly set sail for <i>Mohila</i>, with about 100 <i>Johanna</i> Men.
      The Shoar, on Sight of the Ships, was filled with Men to hinder a Descent
      if intended, but the great Guns soon dispersed this Rabble, and under
      their Cover he landed the <i>Johannians</i>, and an equal Number of <i>French</i>
      and <i>English</i>. They were met by about 700 <i>Mohilians</i>, who
      pretended to stop their Passage, but their Darts and Arrows were of little
      avail against <i>Misson</i>'s Fuzils; the first Discharge made a great
      Slaughter, and about 20 Shells which were thrown among them, put them to a
      confus'd Flight. The Party of <i>Europeans</i> and <i>Johannians</i> then
      marched to their Metropolis, without Resistance, which they reduced to
      Ashes, and the <i>Johannians</i> cut down all the Cocoa Walks that they
      could for the Time, for towards Evening they returned to their Ships, and
      stood off to Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      At their Return to <i>Johanna</i> the Queen made a Festival, and magnified
      the Bravery and Service of her Guests, Friends, and Allies. This Feast
      lasted four Days, at the Expiration of which Time the Queen's Brother
      proposed to Captain <i>Misson</i> the making another Descent, in which he
      would go in Person, and did not doubt subjecting the <i>Mohilians</i>; but
      this was not the Design of <i>Misson</i>, who had Thoughts of fixing a
      Retreat on the North West Side of <i>Madagascar</i>, and look'd upon the
      Feuds between these two Islands advantageous to his Views, and therefore
      no way his Interest to suffer the one to overcome the other; for while the
      Variance was kept up, and their Forces pretty much upon a Level, it was
      evident their Interest would make both Sides caress him; he therefore
      answer'd, that they ought to deliberate on the Consequences, for they
      might be deceived in their Hopes, and find the Conquest less easy than
      they imagined. That the King of <i>Mohilia</i> would be more upon his
      Guard, and not only intrench himself, but gall them with frequent
      Ambuscades, by which they must inevitably lose a Number of Men; and, if
      they were forced to retire with Loss, raise the Courage of the <i>Mohilians</i>,
      and make them irreconcilable Enemies to the <i>Johannians</i>, and
      intirely deprive him of the Advantages with which he might now make a
      Peace, having twice defeated them: That he could not be always with them,
      and at his leaving <i>Johanna</i> he might expect the King of <i>Mohilia</i>
      would endeavour to take a bloody Revenge for the late Damages. The Queen
      gave intirely into <i>Misson's</i> Sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was in Agitation four <i>Mohilians</i> arrived as Ambassadors
      to propose a Peace. They finding the <i>Johannians</i> upon high Terms,
      one of them spoke to this Purpose; O ye Johannians, <i>do not conclude
      from your late Success, that Fortune will be always favourable; she will
      not always give you the Protection of the</i> Europeans, <i>and without
      their Help its possible you might now sue for a Peace, which you seem
      averse to. Remember the Sun rises, comes to its Meridian Height, and stays
      not there, but declines in a Moment. Let this admonish you to reflect on
      the constant Revolution of all sublunary Affairs, and the greater is your
      Glory, the nearer you are to your Declension. We are taught by every Thing
      we see, that there is no Stability in the World, but Nature is in
      continual Movement. The Sea, which o'er flows the Sands has its Bounds
      set, which it cannot pass, which the Moment it has reached, without
      abiding, returns back to the Bottom of the Deep. Every Herb, every Shrub
      and Tree, and even our own Bodies, teach us this Lesson, that nothing is
      durable, or can be counted upon. Time passes away insensibly, one Sun
      follows another, and brings its Changes with it. To-Day's Globe of Light
      sees you strengthened by these</i> Europeans <i>elate with victory, and
      we, who have been used to conquer you, come to ask a Peace. To Morrow's
      Sun may see you deprived of your present Succours, and the</i> Johannians
      <i>petitioning us; as therefore we cannot say what to Morrow may bring
      forth, it would be unwise on uncertain Hopes to forego a certain
      Advantage, as surely Peace ought to be esteem'd by every wise Man</i>.

    <p>
      Having said this, the Ambassadors withdrew, and were treated by the
      Queen's Orders. After the Council had concluded, they were again call'd
      upon, and the Queen told them, that by the Advice of her good Friends, the
      <i>Europeans</i>, and those of her Council, she agreed to make a Peace,
      which she wish'd might banish all Memory of former Injuries That they must
      own the War was begun by them, and that she was far from being the
      Agressor; she only defended her self in her own Kingdom, which they had
      often invaded, though, till within few Days, she had never molested their
      Coasts. If then they really desired to live amicably with her, they must
      resolve to send two of the King's Children, and ten of the first Nobility,
      as Hostages, that they might, when they pleased, return, for that was the
      only Terms on which she would desist prosecuting the Advantages she now
      had, with the utmost Vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ambassadors returned with this Answer, and, about ten Days after, the
      two Ships appearing upon their Coasts, they sent off to give Notice, that
      their King comply'd with the Terms proposed, would send the Hostages, and
      desired a Cessation of all Hostility, and, at the same Time, invited the
      Commanders on Shoar. The <i>Johanna</i> Men on Board disswaded their
      accepting the Invitation; but <i>Misson</i> and <i>Caraccioli</i>, fearing
      nothing, went, but arm'd their Boat's Crew. They were received by the King
      with Demonstrations of Friendship, and they dined with him under a
      Tamerane Tree; but when they parted from him, and were returning to their
      Boats, they were inclosed by, at least, 100 of the <i>Mohilians</i>, who
      set upon them with the utmost Fury, and, in the first Flight of Arrows,
      wounded both the Captains, and killed four of their Boat's Crew of eight,
      who were with them; they, in return, discharged their Pistols with some
      Execution, and fell in with their Cutlasses; but all their Bravery would
      have stood them in little Stead, had not the Report of their Pistols
      alarm'd and brought the rest of their Friends to their Assistance, who
      took their Fuzils, and coming up while they were engaged, discharged a
      Volley on the Back of the Assailants, which laid twelve of them dead on
      the Spot. The Ships hearing this Fire, sent immediately the Yawls and
      Long-Boats well mann'd. Though the Islanders were a little damp'd in their
      Courage by this Fire of the Boats Crew, yet they did not give over the
      Fight, and one of them desperately threw himself upon <i>Caraccioli</i>,
      and gave him a deep Wound in his Side, with a long Knife, but he paid for
      the Rashness of the Attempt with his Life, one of the Crew cleaving his
      Skull. The Yawls and Long-Boats now arrived, and being guided by the
      Noise, reinforced their Companions, put the Traytors to Flight, and
      brought off their dead and wounded. The <i>Europeans</i> lost by this
      Treachery seven slain outright, and eight wounded, six of which recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Crew were resolved to revenge the Blood of their Officers and Comrades
      the next Day, and were accordingly on the Point of Landing, when two
      Canoes came off with two Men bound, the pretended Authors of this Treason,
      without the King's Knowledge, who had sent 'em that they might receive the
      Punishment due to their Villany. The <i>Johanna</i> Men on Board were
      call'd for Interpreters, who having given this Account, added, that the
      King only sacrificed these Men, but that they should not believe him, for
      he certainly had given Orders for assassinating the <i>Europeans</i>; and
      the better Way was to kill all the <i>Mohilians</i> that came in the
      Canoes as well as the two Prisoners; go back to <i>Johanna</i>, take more
      of their Countrymen, and give no Peace to Traytors; but <i>Misson</i> was
      for no such violent Measures, he was averse to every Thing that bore the
      Face of Cruelty and thought a bloody Revenge, if Necessity did not enforce
      it, spoke a groveling and timid Soul; he, therefore, sent those of the
      Canoes back, and bid them tell their King, if before the Evening he sent
      the Hostages agreed upon, he should give Credit to his Excuse, but if he
      did not, he should believe him the Author of the late vile Attempt on his
      Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Canoes went off but returned not with an Answer, wherefore, he bid the
      <i>Johanna</i> Men tell the two Prisoners that they should be set on Shore
      the next Morning, and order'd them to acquaint their King, he was no
      Executioner to put those to Death whom he had condemn'd, but that he
      should find, he knew how to revenge himself of his Treason. The Prisoners
      being unbound, threw themselves at his Feet, and begg'd that he would not
      send them ashore, for they should be surely put to Death, for the Crime
      they had committed, was, the dissuading the barbarous Action of which they
      were accused as Authors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next Day the two Ships landed 200 Men, under the Cover of their Canon; but
      that Precaution of bringing their Ships close to the Shore they found
      needless; not a soul appearing, they march'd two Leagues up the Country,
      when they saw a Body of Men appear behind some Shrubs; <i>Caraccioli's</i>
      Lieutenant, who commanded the right Wing, with fifty Men made up to them,
      but found he had got among Pit Falls artificially cover'd, several of his
      Men falling into them, which made him halt, and not pursue those <i>Mohilians</i>
      who made a feint Retreat to ensnare him, thinking it dangerous to proceed
      farther; and seeing no Enemy would face them, they retired the same Way
      they came, and getting into their Boats, went on Board the Ships,
      resolving to return with a strong Reinforcement, and make Descents at one
      and the same Time in different Parts of the Island. They ask'd the two
      Prisoners how the Country lay, and what the Soil was on the North Side the
      Island; and they answer'd it was morass, and the most dangerous Part to
      attempt, it being a Place where they shelter on any imminent Danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ships return'd to <i>Johanna</i>, where the greatest Tenderness and
      Care was shown for the Recovery and Cure of the two Captains and of their
      Men; they lay six Weeks before they were able to walk the Decks, for
      neither of them would quit his Ship. Their <i>Johanna</i> Wives expressed
      a Concern they did not think them capable of, nay, a Wife of one of the
      wounded Men who died, stood some Time looking upon the Corpse as
      motionless as a Statue, then embracing it, without shedding a Tear,
      desired she might take it ashore to wash and bury it; and at the same
      Time, by an Interpreter, and with a little Mixture of <i>European</i>
      Language, she had, begg'd her late Husband's Friends would take their
      Leave of him the next Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly a Number went ashore, and carried with them the Dividend,
      which fell to his Share, which the Captain order'd to be given his Widow;
      when she saw the Money, she smil'd, and ask'd if all, all that was for
      her? Being answered in the affirmative, and what Good will all that
      shining Dirt do me, if I could with it purchase the Life of my Husband,
      and call him back from the Grave, I would accept it with Pleasure, but as
      it is not sufficient to allure him back to this World, I have no Use for
      it; do with it what you please. Then she desired they would go with her
      and perform the last Ceremonies to her Husband's dead Body, after their
      Country Fashion, least he should be displeased, that she could not stay
      with them, to be a Witness, because she was in haste to go and be married
      again. She startled the <i>Europeans</i> who heard this latter Part of her
      Speech so dissonant from the Beginning; however, they followed her, and
      she led them into a Plantane Walk, where they found a great many <i>Johanna</i>
      Men and Women, sitting under the Shade of Plantanes, round the Corpse,
      which lay (as they all sate) on the Ground, covered with Flowers. She
      embraced them round, and then the <i>Europeans</i>, one by one, and after
      these Ceremonies, she poured out a Number of bitter Imprecations against
      the <i>Mohila</i> Men, whose Treachery had darken'd her Husband's Eyes,
      and made him insensible of her Caresses, who was her first Love, to whom
      she had given her Heart, with her Virginity. She then proceeded in his
      Praises, calling him the Joy of Infants, the Love of Virgins, the Delight
      of the old, and the Wonder of the young, adding, he was strong and
      beautiful as the Cedar, brave as the Bull, tender as the Kid, and loving
      as the Ground Turtle; having finished this Oration, not unlike those of
      the <i>Romans</i>, which the nearest Relation of the deceas'd used to
      pronounce from the Rostrum, she laid her down by the Side of her Husband,
      embracing him, and sitting up again, gave herself a deep Wound under the
      left Breast with a Bayonet, and fell dead on her Husband's Corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Europeans</i> were astonished at the Tenderness and Resolution of
      the Girl, for she was not, by what Her Mien spoke her, past seventeen; and
      they now admired, as much as they had secretly detested her, for saying
      she was in haste to be married again, the Meaning of which they did not
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Husband and Wife were buried, the Crew return'd on Board, and
      gave an Account of what had pass'd; the Captains Wives (for <i>Misson</i>
      and his were on Board the <i>Bijoux</i>, the Name they had given their
      Prize from her Make and Gilding) seem'd not in the least surprized, and <i>Caraccioli's</i>
      Lady only said, she must be of noble Descent, for none but the Families of
      the Nobility had the Privilege allowed them of following their Husbands on
      pain, if they transgressed, of being thrown into the Sea, to be eat by
      Fish; and they knew, that their Souls could not rest as long as any of the
      Fish, who fed upon them, lived. <i>Misson</i> asked, if they intended to
      have done the same Thing had they died? We should not, answer'd his Wife,
      have disgraced our Families; nor is our Tenderness for our Husbands
      inferior to hers whom you seem to admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      After their Recovery, <i>Misson</i> proposes a Cruize, on the Coast of <i>Zangueber</i>,
      which being agreed to, he and <i>Caraccioli</i> took Leave of the Queen
      and her Brother, and would have left their Wives on the Island, but they
      could by no Means be induced to the Separation; it was in vain to urge the
      Shortness of the Time they were to Cruize; they answer'd it was farther
      than <i>Mohila</i> they intended to go, and if they were miserable in that
      short Absence, they could never support a longer; and if they would not
      allow them to keep them Company the Voyage, they must not expect to see
      them at their Return, if they intended one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a Word they were obliged to yield to them, but told them, if the Wives
      of their Men should insist as strongly on following their Example, their
      Tenderness, would be their Ruin, and make them a Prey to their Enemies;
      they answer'd the Queen should prevent that, by ordering no Woman should
      go on board, and if any were in the Ships, they should return on Shore:
      This Order was accordingly made, and they set Sail for the River of <i>Mozembique</i>.
      In about ten Days Cruize after they had left <i>Johanna</i>, and about 15
      Leagues to the Eastward of this River, they fell in with a stout <i>Portuguese</i>
      Ship of 60 Guns, which engaged them from Break of Day till Two in the
      Afternoon, when the Captain being killed, and a great Number of Men lost,
      she struck: This proved a very rich Prize, for she had the Value of 250000
      <i>L</i>. Sterling on Board, in Gold-Dust. The two Women never quitted the
      Decks all the Time of the Engagement, neither gave they the least Mark of
      Fear, except for their Husbands: This Engagement cost them thirty Men, and
      <i>Caraccioli</i> lost his right Leg; the Slaughter fell mostly on the <i>English</i>,
      for of the above Number, twenty were of that Nation: The <i>Portuguese</i>
      lost double the Number. <i>Caraccioli's</i> Wound made them resolve to
      make the best of their Way for <i>Johanna</i> where the greatest Care was
      taken of their wounded, not one of whom died, tho' their Number amounted
      to Twenty seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caraccioli</i> kept his Bed two Months, but <i>Misson</i> seeing him in
      a fair way of Recovery, took what Hands could be spar'd from the <i>Bijoux</i>,
      leaving her sufficient for Defence, and went out, having mounted ten of
      the <i>Portuguese</i> Guns, for he had hitherto carried but thirty, though
      he had Ports for forty. He stretched over to <i>Madagascar</i>, and
      coasted along this Island to the Northward, as far as the most northerly
      Point, when turning back, he enter'd a Bay to the northward of <i>Diego
      Suares</i>. He run ten Leagues up this Bay, and on the larboard Side found
      it afforded a large, and safe, Harbour, with plenty of fresh Water. He
      came here to an Anchor, went ashore and examined into the Nature of the
      Soil, which he found rich, the Air wholesome, and the Country level. He
      told his Men, that this was an excellent Place for an Asylum, and that he
      determined here to fortify and raise a small Town, and make Docks for
      Shipping, that they might have some Place to call their own; and a
      Receptacle, when Age or Wounds had render'd them incapable of Hardship,
      where they might enjoy the Fruits of their Labour, and go to their Graves
      in Peace. That he would not, however, set about this, till he had the
      Approbation of the whole Company; and were he sure they would all approve
      this Design, which he hoped, it being evidently for the general Good, he
      should not think it adviseable to begin any Works, lest the Natives
      should, in his Absence, destroy them; but however, as they had nothing
      upon their Hands, if they were of his Opinion, they might begin to fall
      and square Timber, ready for the raising a wooden Fort, when they return'd
      with their Companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain's Motion was universally applauded, and in ten Days they
      fell'd and rough hew'd a hundred and fifty large Trees, without any
      Interruption from, or seeing any of, the Inhabitants. They fell'd their
      Timber at the Waters Edge, so that they had not the Trouble of hawling
      them any way, which would have employ'd a great deal more Time: They
      returned again, and acquainted their Companions with what they had seen
      and done, and with the Captain's Resolution, which they one and all came
      into.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain <i>Misson</i> then told the Queen, as he had been serviceable to
      her in her War with the Island of <i>Mohila</i>, and might continue to be
      of farther Use, he did not question her lending him Assistance in the
      settling himself on the Coast of <i>Madagascar</i>, and to that end,
      furnish him with 300 Men, to help in his Buildings; the Queen answered,
      she could do nothing without Consent of Council, and that she would
      assemble her Nobility, and did not question their agreeing to any Thing he
      could reasonably define, for they were sensible of the Obligations the <i>Johanians</i>
      had to him. The Council was accordingly called, and <i>Misson</i>'s Demand
      being told, one of the eldest said, he did not think it expedient to
      comply with it, nor safe to refuse; that they should in agreeing to give
      him that Assistance, help to raise a Power, which might prove formidable
      to themselves, by the being so near a Neighbour; and these Men who had
      lately protected, might, when they found it for their Interest, enslave
      them. On the other hand, if they did not comply, they had the Power to do
      them great Damage. That they were to make choice of the least of two
      possible Evils, for he could prognosticate no Good to <i>Johanna</i>, by
      their settling near it. Another answered, that many of them had <i>Johanna</i>
      Wives, that it was not likely they would make Enemies of the <i>Johanna</i>
      Men at first settling, because their Friendship might be of Use to them;
      and from their Children there was nothing to be apprehended in the next
      Generation, for they would be half their own Blood; that in the mean
      while, if they comply'd with the Request, they might be sure of an Ally,
      and Protector, against the King of <i>Mohila</i>; wherefore, he was for
      agreeing to the Demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long Debate, in which every Inconvenience, and Advantage, was
      maturely considered, it was agreed to send with him the Number of Men he
      required, on Condition he should send them back in four Moons, make an
      Alliance with them, and War against <i>Mohila</i>; this being agreed to,
      they staid till <i>Caraccioli</i> was thoroughly recovered, then putting
      the <i>Johannians</i> on board the <i>Portuguese</i> Ship with 40 <i>French</i>
      and <i>English</i> and 15 <i>Portuguese</i> to work her, and setting Sail,
      they arrived at the Place where <i>Misson</i> designed his Settlement,
      which he called <i>Libertalia</i>, and gave the Name of <i>Liberi</i> to
      his People, desiring in that might be drown'd the distingush'd Names of <i>French</i>,
      <i>English</i>, <i>Dutch</i>, <i>Africans</i>, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Thing they sat about was, the raising a Fort on each Side the
      Harbour, which they made of an octogon Figure, and having finished and
      mounted them with 40 Guns taken out of the <i>Portuguese</i>, they raised
      a Battery on an Angle of ten Guns, and began to raise Houses and Magazines
      under the Protection of their Forts and Ships; the <i>Portuguese</i> was
      unrigg'd, and all her Sails and Cordage carefully laid up. While they were
      very busily employed in the raising a Town, a Party which had often hunted
      and rambled four or five Leagues off their Settlement, resolved to venture
      farther into the Country. They made themselves some Huts, at about 4
      Leagues distance from their Companions, and travell'd East South East,
      about 5 Leagues farther into the Country, when they came up with a Black,
      who was arm'd with a Bow, Arrows, and a Javelin; they with a friendly
      Appearance engaged the Fellow to lay by his Fear and go with them. They
      carried him to their Companions, and there entertained him three Days with
      a great Deal of Humanity, and then returned with him near the Place they
      found him, made him a Present of a Piece of scarlet Baze, and an Ax; he
      appeared overjoy'd at the Present, and left them with seeming
      Satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hunters imagined that there might be some Village not far off, and
      observing that he look'd at the Sun, and then took his Way direct South,
      they travell'd on the same Point of the Compass, and from the Top of a
      Hill they spied a pretty large Village, and went down to it; the Men came
      out with their Arms, such as before described, Bows, Arrows, and Javelins,
      but upon two only of the Whites advancing, with Presents of Axes, and Baze
      in their Hands, they sent only four to meet them. The Misfortune was, that
      they could not understand one another, but by their pointing to the Sun,
      and holding up one Finger, and making one of them go forward, and return
      again with shewing their Circumcision, and pointing up to Heaven with one
      Finger, they apprehended, they gave them to understand, there was but one
      God, who had sent one Prophet, and concluded from thence, and their
      Circumcision they were <i>Mahometans</i>; the Presents were carried to
      their Chief, and he seem'd to receive them kindly, and by Signs invited
      the Whites into their Village; but they, remembring the late Treachery of
      the <i>Mohilians</i>, made Signs for Victuals to be brought them where
      they were.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
